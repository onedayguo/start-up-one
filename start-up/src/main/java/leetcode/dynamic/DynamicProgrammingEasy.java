     * Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
     * Initially, there is a number N on the chalkboard.  On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:
     * Choosing any x with 0 < x < N and N % x == 0.
     * Replacing the number N on the chalkboard with N - x.
     * Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.
     * Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.
